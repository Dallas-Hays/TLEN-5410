# might also be helpful.
#
# Note that "restrict" applies to both servers and clients, so a configuration
# that might be intended to block requests from certain clients could also end
# up blocking replies from your own upstream servers.

# By default, exchange time with everybody, but don't allow configuration.

# cryptographically authenticated.

# If you want to provide time to your local subnet, change the next line.

Important thing to note, time.nist.gov is used

start the service

sudo /etc/init.d/ntp start


Check if it's working
sudo ntpq -p

Example:

remote           refid      st t when poll reach   delay   offset  jitter
