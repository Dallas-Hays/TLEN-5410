In addition to UDP and TCP, you can also look at another protocol like ICMP
and information associated with it. There is also routing information for specific
protocols such as rip2 or ospf.

After running: snmpget -c public -v 1 172.20.74.100 .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0
the terminal responded with: SNMPv2-MIB::sysName.0 = STRING: R1.mycompany.com

This means that SNMP version 2 is in use, and found the system name. It returned
the string associated with sysName which was R1.mycompany.com

After running: snmpget -c public -v 1 172.20.74.100 .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5
the terminal responded with:
Error in packet
Reason: (noSuchName) There is no such variable name in this MIB.
Failed object: SNMPv2-MIB::sysName

The reason for the error, as noted in the error description is because sysName
was not found. This is because of the format of the OID, the last values that are
input (.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5). SNMP is able to translate the OID into a command and in
this case, .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5 corresponds to sysName in the SMI subtree. The value
at the 5.0 (adding .0 to the end of the OID) will then give the sysName's value.
Similarly we can look at other parts of the system by changing the values of the
string, like .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2.0 to give us sysObjectID information or .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0
for a sysDescr

netman@netman:~$ snmpget -c public -v 1 172.20.74.100 1.3.6.1.2.1.2.1.0
IF-MIB::ifNumber.0 = INTEGER: 5

By looking up ifNumber I found that 1.3.6.1.2.1.2.1 is associated with
the interface number object. By adding a 0 to the end we can get the value, similar
to question 2
